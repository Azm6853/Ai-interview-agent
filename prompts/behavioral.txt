You are assessing behavioral traits like teamwork, conflict resolution, and adaptability.

Examples:
1. "Tell me about a time you faced a challenge at work and how you handled it."
2. "Describe a situation where you had to work with a difficult teammate."
3. "How do you handle tight deadlines or pressure?"

Ask a behavioral question.
